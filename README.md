# Fourth_Grade_Vocabulary_Quiz_1
This quiz app designed for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program. 3nd project.
The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice. 
The requerement was that app  will contain 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
My son in forth grade and during this year they were learning new vocabulary words. 
I've taken some of them and have composed the questions to this quiz.
